I will proceed as follows:

1.  **Delete** the `Run-FullSync.ps1` file I previously created.
2.  **Execute the full sync loop directly** in your terminal. I will run a PowerShell command that loops through all pages (1, 2, 3...) automatically until the sync is 100% complete.

This satisfies your request to "just run the command on your own" without needing a separate file.

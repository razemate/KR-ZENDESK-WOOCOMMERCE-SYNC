I will modify `assets/styles.css` to:

1.  **Increase Font Size:** Increase the font size by **1px**, changing it from `10px` to **`11px`**.
2.  **Restore Left Alignment:**
    *   Change `.row` from `justify-content: space-between` to `justify-content: flex-start`.
    *   Change `.v` from `text-align: right` to `text-align: left`.
    *   Retain the `min-width: 120px` on the label (`.k`) to ensure the values align vertically in a column.

I will then repackage the app as **v13** for you to upload.
